                    <p class="text-left">Dr. Rebecca Leis serves as the Program Manager/Director for Full Sail Universityâ€™s Computer Science Bachelors, Mobile Development Bachelors, and Mobile Gaming Masters programs. She received her Ph.D. at the University of Central Florida in Modeling and Simulation, where she investigated curriculum development and resource allocation models for graduate education. Specifically, she used natural language processing to investigate the difference between the skills requested, taught, and applied in technology fields, so that education administrators could make more informed data-driven inferences when determining appropriate curriculum. She has also contributed to the development of simulation training and expert systems in safety critical tasks such as those in Nuclear Power Plants and Oil Rigs.</p>
